## Scala Playground

### Compile and Run
compile code with `sbt compile` \
run it with `sbt run` \
`sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

Type sbt in the root directory and type `~run` The ~ is optional and causes 
sbt to re-run on every file save, allowing for a fast edit/run/debug cycle. sbt will also generate a target directory which you can ignore.
